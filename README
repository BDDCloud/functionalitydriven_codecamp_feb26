The source in this repository contains the demo used for the presentation.

Folder structure of the project:
	MediaLibrary
		--- MavenThought.MediaLibrary.sln : Main solution file
		--- Rakefile: Main rake file to launch build, test, etc. Do rake -T to get all the tasks available.
		+-- main: Project files included in the solution
		+-- test: Test project files included in the solution
		+-- lib: Dependencies used by all the projects (nhibernate, nunit, mbunit, etc)
		+-- tools: Tools used to run tests, msbuild tasks, etc.
		
Please read my post with the introduction to the BDD session at http://orthocoders.com/2010/05/26/real-world-bdd-introduction.

Prerequisites to run it:
	* Rake: Install ruby or iron ruby with ruby gems to get rake.
		Here some instructions: http://marcinobel.com/index.php/rake-net-projects-installation-setup/
	* Run the following commands:
		- gem update --system
		- gem install rake capybara --no-ri --no-rdoc
		- gem install bundler
	
Prerequisites to modify it:
	* VS 2010
	* ASP .NET MVC 2: http://www.asp.net/mvc
	
Good to have (highly recommended)
	* Resharper: http://www.jetbrains.com
	* VSCommands: Tool to group and ungroup items (recommended, not required)

Sanity check:
	* From command prompt, on the root of the project run "rake -T", u should see all the tasks.
	* From command prompt, on the root of the project run "rake build"
	* From command prompt, on the root of the project run "rake test:all", all tests should run, u should see the output on the command window.
	* From command prompt, on the root of the project run "rake test:features", all the features should run, u should see the browser 
	  appear and dissaper, and the output on the command window. The result should look something like:
	  
		Tests run: 3, Errors: 0, Failures: 0, Inconclusive: 1, Time.....
	
If u r attending the presentation and have any issues setting up the code feel free to find me and letting me know, I'll help you with the setup.
