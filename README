The source in this repository contains the demo used for the presentation.

Folder structure of the project:

		--- Rakefile: Main rake file to launch build, test, etc. Do rake -T to get all the tasks available.
		+-- main: Project files included in the solution
		+-- test: Test project files included in the solution
		+-- features: Features used by Capybara + Cucumber
		+-- lib2: Dependencies used by the projects that can't be installed with bundler
		+-- tools: Tools used to run tests, msbuild tasks, etc.
		

If you are not familiar with BDD please read my post with the introduction to the BDD at http://orthocoders.com/2010/05/26/real-world-bdd-introduction.

Prerequisites to run it:
	* Install ruby.
		Here some instructions: http://rubyinstaller.org/

	* Make sure ruby is in the path, then run the following commands:
		- gem update --system
		- gem install rake bundler --no-ri --no-rdoc
	
	* Install jRuby
		- Go to http://jruby.org/
	
Prerequisites to modify it:
	* VS 2010
	* ASP .NET MVC 2: http://www.asp.net/mvc
	
		
Sanity check:
	* From command prompt, on the root of the project run "rake -T", u should see all the tasks.
	* From command prompt, on the root of the project run "rake build"
	* From command prompt, on the root of the project run "rake test:all", all tests should run, u should see the output on the command window.
	* From command prompt, on the root of the project run "rake test:features", all the features should run, u should see the browser 
	  appear and dissaper, and the output on the command window. The result should look something like:
	  
		Tests run: 3, Errors: 0, Failures: 0, Inconclusive: 1, Time.....
